App created by Aiden Mayoros for the [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/?utm_campaign=1598884275&utm_term=career%20foundry&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=521397534174&hsa_mt=e&hsa_ad=521397534174&hsa_ver=3&hsa_tgt=kwd-328979525744&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_grp=60753475632&hsa_src=g&hsa_cam=1598884275&hsa_acc=1437185464&hsa_kw=career%20foundry&gclid=Cj0KCQjw27mhBhC9ARIsAIFsETE_sWgPKYswmGXokvQicjE3HAcHT8F3cR4xJC39zfTtYGG-jexMNNkaAm3NEALw_wcB) course boot camp. Created using Fetch API and using advanced UI features like a modal. Modal was first created from vanilla JavaScript aka from scratch and then made again using the Bootstrap library. The navigation header, buttons, modal and list of pokemon all used Bootstrap.

Project utalizes jQuery for Bootstrap as a dependancy and some of the other Javascript code written.

Project includes a search feature to filter out any pokemon that dont match the search upon each button input.

The hardest challenge in this project was to get the custom poke-dex looking modal to work. It was built using a lot of html div tags with a lot of css. Once I got it working from scatch transfering it into Bootstrap was not as hard.

I enjoyed going through the process of learning how modals work and apreciate libraries so much more that offer them to be used so we do not have to build them each time we need them.
